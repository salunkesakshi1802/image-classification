# Fruit vs Vegetable Image Classification

This project involves an image classification model that differentiates between fruits and vegetables. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes a classification notebook (`Image_Classification.ipynb`) and a Flask-based web app (`app.py`) for deploying the trained model. The dataset contains images of various fruits and vegetables, which are used for training and validation.

## Project Structure

- `Image_Classification.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for the image classification model. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- `app.py`: A Flask-based app that loads the trained model and serves the classification results on a web page.
- `Fruits_Vegetables/`: Directory containing the dataset, organized into `train`, `test`, and `validation` folders.
- `Image_classify.keras`: Saved model file after training.
